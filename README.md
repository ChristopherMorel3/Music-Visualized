This project was originally made by the Black-Mamba team for the "Vandyhacks VI" hackathon.
Collaborators include: Cole Alves, Patrick Kong, and Keenan Andre.

The music visualization project is to help indie music artists make a music video using filters and an image.  The image will be modified into a series of images based on the amplitude and frequency of the music that the artist uploads and spits out a video.  

- [ ] Needs to be rewritten/optimized
- [ ] Needs to have more filters
- [ ] Needs to filter large images in a more timely manner
- [ ] Needs to have a front end design
- [ ] Needs to have a full scale working website with this as a backend
- [ ] Optional: Promote the product if it is good
- [ ] Optional: have the filters apply to certain time frames, so multiple filters and can be applied into the video
